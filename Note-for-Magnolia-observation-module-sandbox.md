when publish from 7667 to 8667
Exception: Message received from subscriber: input too large for RSA cipher.
Solution: It is resolved by making sure two author instances are using the same public key. 
Therefore now we are able to publish pages from one author to another author. 

What do you want to do next?
having another public instance (9667) and 8667 -> 9667
having exception: someone is trying to impersonate author instance
